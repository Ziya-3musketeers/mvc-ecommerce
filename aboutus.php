      Early, OG Tech was only a manual store without website and database system, due to the pandamic, the sales had been affected significantly. 
      Besides, records the information manually using file system was been elaminated in this advanced age. 
      Therefore, OG Tech Company completely modernize the system from manual system to online system which is a web application system. 
      However, OG Tech also reserved the old OGthod of selling, which is selling at store, so the custoOGrs have two choices of OGthods to purchase our product.
